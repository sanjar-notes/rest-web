# 1. Motivation

REST is a software architecture style, not a protocol.

It's not just about the endpoint/data-access structure, but also about cacheability and other important aspects of a web service.

It's important to learn REST becasue it's well researched and adopted. Not knowing REST will eventually cause invention of something similar to it, albeit with trial and error.

Better, learn REST in the beginning itself.
